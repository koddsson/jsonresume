# jsonresume

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/koddsson/jsonresume.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

I'm a _huge_ fan of the [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/) project. I have some issues with the
current state of it.

- The standard/schema seems very complicated where it should be easy to read.
- The operational complexity of the project (registry-server)
- Some of the themes are not under the umbrella of jsonresume so if there's a
  hotfix to be made it has to go through a third-party.
